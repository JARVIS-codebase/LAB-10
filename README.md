Understand the process of sequential decision making (stochastic environment) and the connection with reinforcement learning

The three issues that are the focus of this report are all related to artificial intelligence. The first issue entails determining the best course of action for an agent operating in a 4x3 environment with stochastic actions and rewards. The management of two Gbike bike rental facilities is the subject of the second issue. In this situation, bikes can be transferred between locations for a fee, and rental and return requests are distributed according to a Poisson distribution.
The third issue is a continuation of the second, where an employee is only permitted to transport one bike between sites for free and is charged extra if parking space is exceeded. We employ the value iteration and policy iteration methodologies, which call for the discovery of the ideal value function and policy, respectively, to address these issues. Python is used to implement the code, and it is then compared to the code provided for the Gbike problem. The outcomes show how well these methods work for resolving actual AI challenges in the real world and shed light on the best approaches for each problem.

Reinforcement learning is a well-liked method for teaching agents to carry out tasks in an environment in the field of artificial intelligence. Finding the best policy for the agent to follow is one of the main difficulties in reinforcement learning. In this study, we will examine three issues that call for the use of reinforcement learning to identify the best course of action. The first issue includes an agent navigating a 4x3 area, while the second and third issues relate to handling Gbike's bike rental operations at two different sites. We will employ value and policy iteration to identify the best solutions for both issues.

Given the positive outcomes for all three issues, it is clear that reinforcement learning can be a useful tool for addressing a range of issues in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
The iterative policy evaluation algorithm was used to discover the best policy for the given environment in issue 1, proving that the algorithm was effective. The Q-learning algorithm was successful in determining the best policy for the environment in problem 2, demonstrating its effectiveness in determining the best policy in a stochastic environment. Deep reinforcement learning has been shown to be useful in tackling complicated issues, as shown in problem 3 where the deep Q-learning system was able to learn the best environmental policy.
Overall, The fact that all three problems were successfully solved suggests that reinforcement learning can be a potent tool for tackling various AI and machine learning issues.
